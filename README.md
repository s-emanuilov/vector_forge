## üß© Features

- **Image to Vector Conversion**: Easily convert individual images into feature vectors by specifying your desired model
  to extract meaningful representations.
- **Batch Processing**: Provide a folder path to process multiple images in bulk. Select your preferred model and let
  Vector Forge swiftly handle all the images in the specified directory.
- **Text to Vector Transformation**: Effortlessly convert textual data into vectors. Choose your model, and Vector Forge
  will transform your text input into a high-dimensional vector representation.
- **Support for Multiple Models**: Vector Forge supports various models for vectorization, including CLIP, Xception, and
  VGG16, to provide flexibility in handling different data types.
- **Serialization Simplified**: Save your vectors as pickle files for easy storage and retrieval, whether for archival
  purposes or future use.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Requirements

- [Python 3.11](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3114/)

## üì¶ Supported models
- CLIP (PyTorch)
- VGG16 (Keras)
- XCEPTION (Keras)

## üéõÔ∏è Usage

### üîß Installation

```shell
pip install vector_forge
```

### üîå Create a vectorizer

#### Import the library

```python
import vector_forge as vf
```

#### Default vectorizer

```python
# By default, the vectorizer is CLIP
# it works for text and images
vectorizer = vf.Vectorizer()  
```

#### Change the vectorizer to use a different model

```python
# Change the vectorizer to Keras XCeption
vectorizer = vf.Vectorizer(model=vf.Models.XCEPTION)
```

#### Text to Vector

```python
# Convert text to vector
text_embedding = vectorizer.text_to_vector("Nice text!")
```

#### Image to Vector

```python
# Convert image to vector
image_embedding = vectorizer.image_to_vector("/path/to/image.jpg")
```

#### Return types
In Vector Forge, you have the flexibility to choose the format in which the vectors are returned. This is controlled by the return_type parameter available in the image_to_vector and text_to_vector methods of the Vectorizer class. Here are the available return types along with examples:
- **numpy:** This is the default return type. Vectors are returned as NumPy arrays.
```python
image_embedding = vectorizer.image_to_vector("/path/to/image.jpg", return_type="numpy")
# Output: array([0.0234, 0.0345, ..., 0.0456])
```

- **str:** Vectors are returned as a string representation of the NumPy array.
```python
image_embedding = vectorizer.image_to_vector("/path/to/image.jpg", return_type="str")
# Output: "[0.0234, 0.0345, ..., 0.0456]"
```

- **list**: Vectors are returned as a list of values.
```python
image_embedding = vectorizer.image_to_vector("/path/to/image.jpg", return_type="list")
# Output: [0.0234, 0.0345, ..., 0.0456]
```

- **2darray**: Vectors are returned as a 2-dimensional NumPy array, where each vector is a row in the array. This format is especially useful when you want to compute similarities or perform other vectorized operations.
```python
image_embedding = vectorizer.image_to_vector("/path/to/image.jpg", return_type="2darray")
# Output: array([[0.0234, 0.0345, ..., 0.0456]])
```

#### Batch Processing for images

```python
# Convert all images in a folder to vectors
for vector in vectorizer.load_from_folder("/path/to/folder"):
    print(vector.shape)
```

You can choose the return type that best suits your needs based on the downstream tasks you plan to perform with the vectors generated by Vector Forge.

### üß™ Complete example

```python
import vector_forge as vf
from sklearn.metrics.pairwise import cosine_similarity


def compute_similarity(vectorizer, text, image_path):
    # Convert text and image to vectors with return type '2darray'
    text_embedding = vectorizer.text_to_vector(text, return_type="2darray")
    image_embedding = vectorizer.image_to_vector(image_path, return_type="2darray")

    # Compute cosine similarity
    similarity = cosine_similarity(text_embedding, image_embedding)[0][0]
    return similarity


# Create a vectorizer with the default CLIP model
vectorizer = vf.Vectorizer()

# Define text and image paths
text = "A couple of birds"
image_path_1 = "vector_forge/test_data/birds.jpg"
image_path_2 = "vector_forge/test_data/sample.jpg"

# Compute and print similarity scores
similarity_1 = compute_similarity(vectorizer, text, image_path_1)
similarity_2 = compute_similarity(vectorizer, text, image_path_2)

print(f"Similarity between text and first image: {similarity_1}")
print(f"Similarity between text and second image: {similarity_2}")
```
